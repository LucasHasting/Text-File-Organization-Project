# Text File Organization Project
This repositroy holds a python project that will show content based on a heading and sub-heading. It uses a Cisco IOS Cheat Sheet that I made as an example.

## Notice for when the code is read
This project's purpose is the execution of the code, not the beauty of it. This project was a side project I made in highschool. As such, the code is poorly written and hard to read, I appologize for that, but I no longer remember how I made this as it was most likely over complicated and I no longer wish to remember how I made it.
